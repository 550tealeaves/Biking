    Biking is the best exercise!
</h1>
<p>
    Getting adequate exercise is often difficult for most people. After long hours at school, work, or caring for a
    family, most simply lack the time and resources to dedicate to weekly rounds at the gym. Biking is a great and
    affordable alternative that provides similar <span> <strong>cardiovascular benefits</strong> </span> ðŸ©º as a session
    on the elliptical and can more easily fit into busy schedules.
